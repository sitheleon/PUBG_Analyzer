# Analysis of the Correlation Between Survival Strategies (Camping) and Win Rate in PUBG

## (1) Reason for Topic Selection
- PUBG, as a representative of the battle royale genre, emphasizes being the last survivor and requires diverse strategies.
- Among these strategies, "camping" minimizes combat with enemies and focuses on maximizing survival time as a defensive tactic. 

## (2) Research Objective
- To explore whether camping, as a survival strategy, has a significant impact on the win rate of players.
- To provide insights for players seeking to optimize their gameplay by understanding the effectiveness of defensive strategies.

## (3) Research Questions
1. Does increased survival time directly correlate with higher win rates in PUBG?
2. How does the frequency of combat engagements affect win rates for defensive players?
3. What are the statistical differences between players who adopt camping strategies versus aggressive strategies in terms of overall performance?

## (4) Data Collection
- Source: PUBG Developer API.
- Key variables: survival time, win rate, kill count, damage dealt, and placement.
- Tools: Python with libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for data analysis.

## (5) Methodology
1. **Data Analysis:**
   - Examine the relationship between survival time and win rate.
   - Compare metrics such as average kill count and damage dealt for camping vs. aggressive players.
2. **Statistical Testing:**
   - Perform correlation and regression analysis to identify significant relationships.
3. **Visualization:**
   - Use charts and graphs to present findings clearly.

## (6) Expected Results
- Defensive strategies like camping are expected to improve survival time but may have diminishing returns on win rates without sufficient combat skills.
- Balanced strategies that incorporate both defensive and offensive elements might yield the highest win rates.

## (7) Potential Challenges
- Data limitations, such as distinguishing between true camping and other forms of low combat engagement.
- Variability in gameplay styles based on player skill and external factors like match conditions.

## (8) Conclusion
- The research aims to shed light on the viability of camping as a competitive strategy in PUBG.
- By understanding the impact of survival-focused playstyles, players can make more informed decisions to enhance their performance.
